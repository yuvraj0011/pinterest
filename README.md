I created a Pinterest-inspired project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice front-end skills. It features a responsive masonry grid layout, smooth hover effects, and dynamic image loading with endless scrolling. I also implemented a search function, enhancing user interaction and improving my skills in web design and interactivity.
